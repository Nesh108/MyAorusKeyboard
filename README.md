# MyAorusKeyboardSDK
Aorus RGB Keyboard SDK for C#

## Introduction ##
The Aorus Fusion application provided with the Aorus series allows to set custom profiles, macros and select among default styles.
While that could be enough for certain users, pro-users and developers might be interested in having more control over their keyboard.

After contacting both Gigabyte and Aorus technical support and being told that a public SDK is not available, I went ahead and made one.

Pull requests and issues are welcome as this is a still very young repository.
